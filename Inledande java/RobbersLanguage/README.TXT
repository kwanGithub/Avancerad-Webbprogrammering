VERSION: 0.2

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: From BlueJ right click RobbersLanguageGUI and choose "new RobbersLanguageGUI()"
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Translates a text into the robber language (rövarspråket) made famous in the book about 
Kalle Blomkvist written by Astrid Lindgren. In the robber language you duplicate all consonants and add 'o' 
between then. "b" becomes "bob" and "i love peace" becomes "i lolovove popeacoce".
